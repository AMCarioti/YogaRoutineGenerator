# YogaRoutineGenerator
A yoga routine generator that I created while training for a company after graduating college.

HOW TO USE:

1). Select one of the three options for length of your routine,

2). A move will be displayed with a short description on how to do it as well as a length of time to practice that move for,

3). When finished with the current move, press ENTER to move on to the next move,

4). After the final move, a display message will let you know that you are done with your practice.

ENJOY!,
